### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Johannes and I'm a Software Engineer from Germany. I work 100% remote for [sipgate](https://github.com/sipgate) where I help build the excellent app [satellite](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/satellite-mobil-telefonieren/id1322354195), which is IMHO the best softphone for iOS. Apart from building accessible user interfaces I enjoy wrangling SIP and CallKit in particular.

Some other things I enjoy:

- Self-hosting and home labs
- Apple Shortcuts
- Figuring out, whether I can finally archive that side project I've abandoned months ago

I'm open to any kind of question. Just shoot me a message on [Mastodon ðŸ“§](https://mastodon.social/@technocidal)
